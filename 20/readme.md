## Abstract 
The project concerns the processing of data from gas sensors , it will be displayed in graph format: 


## Data structure

| data | type |
| ------ | ------ |
| INPUT | file.csv |
| OUTPUT | visualization |

## Main functionalities

1. relational database based on SQL language
1. frot-end created in JavaScript and CSS technologies
1. back-end executed in PHP language and auxiliary scripts

The above functionalities are tested and work according to their roles.
